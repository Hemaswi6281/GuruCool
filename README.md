### <p align = "center"> GuruCool is a one-in-all progressive classroom management solution to online education with Gamified approach to learning and enhanced Moderation functions for educators </p>

## KEY FEATURES 
* Progressive Web Application with Moderation Functionality for Teachers/Educators to keep student activity under check.

* Gamified Approach to Learning, with the introduction of a Point-Based in-app Quiz System with leaderboard and levelling up options. The Quiz can be set and triggered by the teacher on their will, and the students will have to answer the question before a stipulated time. This system ensures lecture attention, in addition to engagement through a competitive mindset. We psychologically try to hack the minds of the learners to capture their concentration on the classes.

* Complete Classroom Management features with Dashboard where the students can join any particular subjectâ€™s class using a link generated by the teachers
* Collaborative Whiteboard feature for teachers and students to brainstorm ideas and teach.
* Student attendance export system, where the teachers can export the list of the meeting attendees with the click of a single button instead of taking screenshots of names or verbally taking attendance. 
* Role-based single-click SIGN UP/LOGIN system.

## TECH STACK USED 
* React + Redux
* SCSS
* Node JS
* Express.js
* MongoDB
